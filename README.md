# Python Prometheus Client and Web Server

This codebase will contain code and information I gather regarding python web servers using Flask as well as Prometheus. The objective here will be to set up a web-server using Flask that can be used by Prometheus to scrape some metrics. The other thing I will try to accomplish here is practice how to use the Prometheus client library for Python.

So far I know the Prometheus client libarary has means of creating a webserver built in but as a learning exercise I will attempt to set up my own Flask server to enable Prometheus to scrape metrics from some dummy source.

Will update this doc with info and knowledge as i go along.
